Assignment 3 : Bayesian inference on the given data

	In this assignment, we had to use Bayesian network which is a directed acyclic graphical representation of a set of variables and their conditional dependencies.
Each variable is represented as a node in the graph and a directed edge between the nodes represents parent-child relationship between the considered nodes. 
	We have estimated probability distributions	of parameters of a given network. The following steps are followed for solving this problem - 
		1. From the first input file, we have created a dependency graph among the initial variables
		2. Using the second input file, we have created the Bayesian network and calculated the independent probabilities of each initial variables
		3. Now following the Bayesian network created earlier, we have found out all the possible combinations using Cartesian product
		4. Finally, the result of this assignment is estimated probability distributions of all the combinations parameters created earlier
